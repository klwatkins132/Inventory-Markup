# Inventory-Markup
Java CLI Inventory Markup Program

This is a program that uses a loop to read a Data.txt file from your hard drive and creates an inventory report based on the data in the file. 
The program will write back to the hard drive creating a file called Inventory.txt. The programâ€™s purpose is to add the designated markup cost to products.
The program then outputs the product names, original raw-costs, and product costs after markup (calculated using the formula itemCost(x) * 1.3).
